## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict the price of used cars using a linear regression model. The dataset contains various features, such as car make, model, year, mileage, etc., which are used to train the model and make predictions.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Linear-Regression-Second-Hand-Car-Price-Prediction.git
cd Linear-Regression-Second-Hand-Car-Price-Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

## Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can run the Jupyter Notebook:

\`\`\`bash
jupyter notebook 1_Linear_Regression_for_Predicting_Price_of_second_hand_Cars_by_Neuralearn_ai_.ipynb
\`\`\`

This notebook walks you through the steps to train the model and predict car prices.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model should be in the following format (or similar):
- **Make:** The brand of the car
- **Model:** The specific model of the car
- **Year:** The year the car was manufactured
- **Mileage:** The distance the car has been driven
- **Price:** The price of the car

You can load your own dataset or use a sample dataset to run the code.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (RÂ²) score. You can view the results within the Jupyter Notebook.
